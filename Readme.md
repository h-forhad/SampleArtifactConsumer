# SampleArtifactConsumer

This is an Android app that consumes the artifacts generated by the PSCORE library.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between">
    <img src="img.png" width="49%"/>
    <img src="img_1.png" width="49%"/>
</div>

The app is to demonstrate how the artifacts can be consumed by an Android app.

The app consumes the following artifacts:

- `com.local.pscore:core:0.0.1`
- `com.local.pscore:tasks:0.0.2`
- `com.local.pscore:search:0.0.1`
